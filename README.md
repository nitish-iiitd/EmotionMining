# Emotion Mining

## Problem Statement 
Given an input text, classify that text into one of five kinds of emotions, which are joy, anger, fear, sadness and surprise. 
Four different models are to be used for emotion classification.
First two are simple - LDA and Logistic Regression.  
Next two are advanced - SVM with kernel and Task based Deep learning.

## Dataset  
We Feel Fine API dataset

## Steps to run the project
Step 1 - Go to directory `Preprocess` and run the file `preprocess.py`.
Step 2 - Go to directory `Vectorizer` and run the file `countvect.py`.
Step 3 - Go to any model directory for eg. `LDA`,`SVM` etc and run the file inside that folder.
